# Wired-cum-Wireless-Network-Simulation-ns2
A simple network simulation in ns2 of Wired (IEEE802.3) and Wireless 802.11 cross flow network measuring performance metrics like throughput, packet transfer ratio, average end-to-end delay with respect to variation in number of nodes, flows and  number of packets per second.
